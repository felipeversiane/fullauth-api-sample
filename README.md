# Deploy Django and Nextjs using Nginx, Celery, Redis and Postgresql with Docker

Where it is described how this boilerplate was created from scratch so that you can build your own.

## Advantages
1. Ready to use with your django/nextjs project.
2. Combined with NGINX, Redis, Celery, Tailwind to handle relevent things.
3. Alpine based images are used, so that sizes of the images are compartively low.
4. Now comes built it with Numpy, Scipy and Pandas support. So you can integrate your datascience projects with this. [Instructions](#now-featuring-numpy-scipy-and-pandas) for integrating these libraries are also shared in the `Dockerfile`.
5. With Numpy, Pandas and Scipy dependecies installed, the total size is 657MB(may differ if you have more packages). Without these, size reduces to 390MB.
6. Now comes with support to install [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) using django.

## Basic Usage
1. First run **`make build`** inside root directory.
2. Then run **`make up`** to start up the project for first time.

Checkout the [commands](#commands) section for more usage.

## Preview
A default Django project resides in `src` directory. So, when you start the project, you will see the following screen in `8000` port:
